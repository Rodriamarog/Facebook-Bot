Dec 5:
We have to make the post_to_facebook.py script post the actual values of the wait times and not the dummy values.
We have to create the single product website and setup stripe or mercado pago or some shit to accept payments.
We have to figure out how to comment on the post with a link to the website so they can purchase the shit.
Or for now, maybe a link to buymeacoffe or something?
